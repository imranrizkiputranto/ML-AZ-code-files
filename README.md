# Machine Learning A-Z<sup>:tm:</sup> Code Files
This repository contains code files I have personally coded in conjunction with projects included in the "Machine Learning A-Z<sup>:tm:</sup>" online course on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Course Description
Machine Learning A-Z is a popular online course on Udemy that covers a wide range of machine learning topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction and deep learning. The course utilizes various machine learning algorithms and frameworks such as Python's scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Contents
This repository is organised into multiple folders, each corresponding to a specific section or topic covered in the course. The code files are provided as Python scripts (.py). Additionally, the repository may include datasets and other necessary resources for running the code. The code files are named according to the corresponding lessons or exercises in the course.

## Usage
To use the code files in this repository, you will need a working installation of Python and the necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. You can run the code files by opening them in a Jupyter notebook environment or executing the Python scripts using a Python interpreter. Please note that the code provided in this repository is for educational purposes and meant to accompany the "Machine Learning A-Z<sup>:tm:</sup>" course. It is encouraged to experiment, modify, and build upon the code to deepen your understanding of the covered topics.
